## Project Introduction & description

Marble maze is a game featuring tilt controls. Roll your Marble through increasingly challenging mazes. Choose your comfortable difficulty, or try creating your own with Freeplay mode. Roll fast for the high score spot, and play often for daily marbles!

I chose to develop a Marble maze. I felt that it would be an impressive app to show to an employer And that learning App development would give me well-rounded practice with coding. I find the app's full use of the phone's sensors gives the app a flourish and leg above other apps.

The app will be capable of generating mazes with different sizes and difficulties using the desired parameters. Parameters can either be preset difficulty settings or fully configured to whatever the user desires.
